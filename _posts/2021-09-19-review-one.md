##### Summary  
_Charles Booth’s London: Poverty maps and police notebooks_ is a digital humanities project that consists of Charles Booth’s Inquiry into Life and Labour in London research from the late 1800s and early 1900s. The purpose of this project is to allow users an effortless way to explore poverty in London during this period. The project is a compilation of Charles Booth’s poverty map and his many notebooks on policing, the Stepney Union, the Jewish population, poverty, industry life, and religion in London. Booth’s survey is the only one, conducted during this time, that has both the surviving original notes and data.  
Through this research, we can further understand the development of the methodology and philosophy of Social Investigation in the United Kingdom. The user can then begin to explore and develop their own understanding of poverty during this period. By looking at society’s interpretation of poverty over time, we can decipher the changes that have occurred and begin to recognize the societal fault that it is.
