##### Summary  
_Charles Booth’s London: Poverty maps and police notebooks_ is a digital humanities project that consists of Charles Booth’s Inquiry into Life and Labour in London research from the late 1800s and early 1900s. The purpose of this project is to allow users an effortless way to explore poverty in London during this period. The project is a compilation of Charles Booth’s poverty map and his many notebooks on policing, the Stepney Union, the Jewish population, poverty, industry life, and religion in London. Booth’s survey is the only one, conducted during this time, that has both the surviving original notes and data.  
Through this research, we can further understand the development of the methodology and philosophy of Social Investigation in the United Kingdom. The user can then begin to explore and develop their own understanding of poverty during this period. By looking at society’s interpretation of poverty over time, we can decipher the changes that have occurred and begin to recognize the societal fault that it is.  
##### Design  
The project was able to flourish by using many open projects and services. Of these open projects and services are Elasticsearch, The Universal Viewer, IIIF, OpenStreetMap, and OS Names API. The project is best to be used on a computer. Mobile devices do not allow users to fully experience the maps and notebook collection. The project is set up so the user can zoom up to 275% on a computer without the text spilling off the page. There are little to no directions on how to use the project in the About tab, forcing the user to figure it out for themselves. The project creators worked hard to make sure that the project is accessible, like the ability to use a screen reader on a majority of the website, and state that they are working on the portions of the project that are not currently fully accessible.  
##### Findings  
_Charles Booth’s London: Poverty maps and police notebooks_ and its creator did a comprehensive job at compiling all of the surviving notes and data and making it accessible on the internet with interactive features that bring you through the notebooks and map. By this project, a user can explore Booth’s poverty map and cross-examine it with a map of modern-day London. Additionally, the user can explore Booth’s original notebooks, as users can flip through the pages.  
###### Maps

This project brings historical research into the modern day with the ability to transfer between the Charles Booth Poverty map and modern-day London. Additionally, the sliding bar at the bottom of the map allows the user to view both the the maps simultaneously. While this feature is very interesting and allows the user to see the past and present combined, the coloring of the present-day map takes away from the colors that Booth laid out in his legend. Subsequently, having the ability to efficiently zoom in and see every small detail of Booth’s maps makes the project itself more accessible. Additionally, the project creators thoughtfully put a search bar at the top of the map that allowed users to search for specific subjects they are interested in. With that said, most search results only bring the user to a place on the map and not a notebook.  
###### Notebooks

The notebooks bring the user through a large array of materials. Most, if not all, of Booth’s surviving journals from the original Inquiry can be found and explored through this project. With that being said, the notebooks are just high-definition scans of the original pages. There are no text transcriptions of what is said on the pages. This creates a tremendous barrier for those who are unable to read cursive. Additionally, the user can either explore the notebooks through the map, by clicking on the dot at any location or search for it through the Notebooks tab. The map is intriguing and is excellent in helping the user explore specific locations in London in correlation to what Booth inquired about the area. The project does not take into account user accessibility when it comes to Booth’s notebooks and their names. All of the notebooks are sorted into subsections under the notebook tab, but from there finding the right subject is a complete guessing game. All of the notebooks are named similarly to the following, BOOTH/A/123. There is so much information that could be accessed through these notebooks, but the lack of names could deter a user from spending the time to search for what they need.  
###### Hightlights

On a separate tab, the project holds highlights on three common themes that developed throughout the notebooks. Of these themes are, Drink and Drugs, Migrant Communities, and Prostitution. The tab is concise and well set up so the user can explore an overview of the subjects and find quotes that, when clicked on, can bring you to the respective page in the notebooks.
