##### Summary  
_Charles Booth’s London: Poverty maps and police notebooks_ is a digital humanities project that consists of Charles Booth’s Inquiry into Life and Labour in London research from the late 1800s and early 1900s. The purpose of this project is to allow users an effortless way to explore poverty in London during this period. The project is a compilation of Charles Booth’s poverty map and his many notebooks on policing, the Stepney Union, the Jewish population, poverty, industry life, and religion in London. Booth’s survey is the only one, conducted during this time, that has both the surviving original notes and data.  
Through this research, we can further understand the development of the methodology and philosophy of Social Investigation in the United Kingdom. The user can then begin to explore and develop their own understanding of poverty during this period. By looking at society’s interpretation of poverty over time, we can decipher the changes that have occurred and begin to recognize the societal fault that it is.  
##### Design  
The project was able to flourish by using many open projects and services. Of these open projects and services are Elasticsearch, The Universal Viewer, IIIF, OpenStreetMap, and OS Names API. The project is best to be used on a computer. Mobile devices do not allow users to fully experience the maps and notebook collection. The project is set up so the user can zoom up to 275% on a computer without the text spilling off the page. There are little to no directions on how to use the project in the About tab, forcing the user to figure it out for themselves. The project creators worked hard to make sure that the project is accessible, like the ability to use a screen reader on a majority of the website, and state that they are working on the portions of the project that are not currently fully accessible.  
##### Findings  
_Charles Booth’s London: Poverty maps and police notebooks_ and its creator did a comprehensive job at compiling all of the surviving notes and data and making it accessible on the internet with interactive features that bring you through the notebooks and map. By this project, a user can explore Booth’s poverty map and cross-examine it with a map of modern-day London. Additionally, the user can explore Booth’s original notebooks, as users can flip through the pages.
