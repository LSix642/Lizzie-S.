The above word cloud is based on the most used words from all of my blog posts this semester.

### Where We All Began...  
Writing Intensives have always been daunting. The title itself points out the vigorous nature of these courses. The first image that came to my mind when enrolling in this course was hours of sitting at my desk writing word after word until I couldn’t anymore. My image of this course was unwavering until I was able to look at the syllabus right before the first class. Seeing “Twitter Posts” on a syllabus was something that really caught my attention and for some reason eased the pressure I was preparing myself to feel. On the other hand, I saw assignments related to setting up a blog with instructions that included coding and I believe I began to have heart palpitations. That said, I knew all of the assignments, no matter the seeming difficulty, could not be weighed until the professor’s teaching style was presented.  
From the first class, I could tell that I was going to really enjoy the content and learn a lot. Most of all I could tell that I was going to like the way that the course was structured both in the classroom and out. I liked that many of our classes were going to be workshops and peer-reviews because I always need someone to look for small mistakes so I can feel confident in submitting my work. That said, overall, I could tell that I would really like the professor and she seemed like she truly understood the struggles that we students are enduring through such unprecedented times.
