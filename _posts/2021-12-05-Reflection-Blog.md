## Reflection Blog

The above word cloud is based on the most used words from all of my blog posts this semester.

### Where We All Began...  
Writing Intensives have always been daunting. The title itself points out the vigorous nature of these courses. The first image that came to my mind when enrolling in this course was hours of sitting at my desk writing word after word until I couldn’t anymore. My image of this course was unwavering until I was able to look at the syllabus right before the first class. Seeing “Twitter Posts” on a syllabus was something that really caught my attention and for some reason eased the pressure I was preparing myself to feel. On the other hand, I saw assignments related to setting up a blog with instructions that included coding and I believe I began to have heart palpitations. That said, I knew all of the assignments, no matter the seeming difficulty, could not be weighed until the professor’s teaching style was presented.  
From the first class, I could tell that I was going to really enjoy the content and learn a lot. Most of all I could tell that I was going to like the way that the course was structured both in the classroom and out. I liked that many of our classes were going to be workshops and peer-reviews because I always need someone to look for small mistakes so I can feel confident in submitting my work. That said, overall, I could tell that I would really like the professor and she seemed like she truly understood the struggles that we students are enduring through such unprecedented times.  

### Readings  
In the beginning, I really enjoyed the readings. They allowed me to look at the digital humanities from a much larger lens than I could have ever imagined. During the first couple of weeks, the reading that really caught my attention was the Nielsen Norman Group Eyetracking. I was so intrigued by the patterns that we all make when reading and what I was the most drawn to when reading articles. In past classes, I had felt like I was reading different variants of the same information. This course was nothing like that. Each reading brought up something new and exciting about the Digital Humanities and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  
Truthfully, as the semester progressed, the readings got harder to complete. There was no real balance in the number of readings from day to day. Some days there were no readings and other days there could be up to 5 readings expected to be done. I wish that some of the readings were spread out and into the grant writing time to make it more manageable and easier to tweet.  

### Assignments  
##### Twitter  
I really enjoyed the Twitter posts element to the class. I have always been a very descriptive writer and learning to be able to get my point across in such a limited amount of space is something I have needed to work on for a while. Having to post 3 times a week made sure that I was fully engaged in the course material and reminded me of what we were learning in class. I am appreciative that I now have to place to look back and find short summaries from each week in the class.  
The only downside to the tweets was having to respond to someone weekly. In the beginning, it was easy because my classmates would post their tweets on time, but in the end, I found myself having to wait for others to post their tweets. I am the type of person who likes to be on top of my work and to lessen my workload whenever possible, so waiting for others could be frustrating at times.  
##### Blogs
Although the blog posts were challenging at times, I learned so much about how to write for an audience and how to set up a blog website as a whole. Learning how to code in Github is something that I never thought I would be able to say I accomplished.   
My favorite blog assignment was the Thinglink Map. I did my map based on four of my favorite memories from each year at CNU. Although it might look like just an assignment that I completed, I showed it to my mom and she cried. It is amazing to me how something that I made for a class could inflict such emotions.

##### Grant Proposal
Writing the grant proposal was probably the most challenging part of the course. I had never even read a grant proposal before, let alone tried to construct my own from scratch. I was very appreciative of all of the peer reviews that we had in class. The schedule of doing a peer review almost weekly kept me from procrastinating and extinguished fears of completing the whole project incorrectly.  
Having a partner to complete the proposal with was more than helpful. We would meet weekly to write whatever section needed to be peer-reviewed next. In past group projects, we would just split up the work and combine all of the sections together. My partner and I took a different approach, where we wrote each sentence together. It was very interesting to see both of our writing styles combined.  
### What DH Means to Me Now  
Coming into this course I had no idea what the Digital Humanities entailed. I now feel like I can form my own definition of the digital humanities and identify what qualifies a project as a digital humanities project.  
I would define the digital humanities as an academic concentration that uses interactive technological components to convey traditional humanities sectors, such as literature and performing arts.  
### My Growth Through This Course  
Through this course, I have learned so much about the subject and even more about myself as a writer. As I stated, I have always been a very descriptive writer, so having to switch to writing in a way that would capture an audience’s attention was quite a change for me. I now am able to write concisely and even more importantly, I believe I have gained many technological skills that will do me well in my future of policy reform and advocacy.
