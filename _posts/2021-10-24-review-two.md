##### Summary  
_Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America_ is a digital humanities project that is a compilation of the HOLC (Home Owners’ Loan Corporation) descriptions and mapping of specific neighborhoods across the country from 1935-1940. The purpose of this project is to highlight the government-endorsed redlining that occurred through the HOLC project in the mid-late 1930s. Redlining is a racially discriminatory practice in which large companies, such as insurance companies and banks, refuse loans to individuals they do not perceive as acceptable residents in a certain geographic area. The HOLC made grades based on how the lenders, developers, and real estate appraisers of the area perceived the neighborhood.  
Through this project, the user can further understand how redlining worked and how it was consistently racially motivated. The maps and descriptions show a continuity of neighborhoods being given a low grade when its population was a majority filled with minority populations. This project allows users to explore the history of redlining and begin to understand the effects that redlining had on communities.  
##### Design  
This site was designed with the use of three mapping programs, Leaflet, MapBox, and OpenStreet Map. A large portion of the project is based on a map that users can explore. The map has many small icons and intricate details, so the project is best to be viewed on a computer. If a user were to attempt to view this project on a mobile phone/device, it would make the experience much more difficult. The map requires the user to zoom into different cities, and when done so the map and descriptions are placed next to each other. Because of this layout, viewing this portion of the project on a mobile device is nearly impossible.  
The project has four main sections, the Map, Introduction, Downloads and Data, and About. The site’s ability to zoom into any specific area or neighborhood on the map that the user wishes to explore and examine the descriptions is a small detail added to the project but makes the user’s experience much more enjoyable.  
##### Credit  
There were hundreds of individuals that contributed to this project. The project was developed by three teams at four universities (The University of Richmond, Virginia Tech, The University of Maryland, and Duke University). Additionally, the project pulled in highly valued researchers, authors, and acclaimed professors from across the country. The project’s funding came from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, The Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, and MapBox provided base tiles.

##### Findings  
Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America does an excellent job of combing the history of redlining and technology in an easily digestible and navigatable way.
