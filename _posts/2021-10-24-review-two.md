##### Summary  
_Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America_ is a digital humanities project that is a compilation of the HOLC (Home Owners’ Loan Corporation) descriptions and mapping of specific neighborhoods across the country from 1935-1940. The purpose of this project is to highlight the government-endorsed redlining that occurred through the HOLC project in the mid-late 1930s. Redlining is a racially discriminatory practice in which large companies, such as insurance companies and banks, refuse loans to individuals they do not perceive as acceptable residents in a certain geographic area. The HOLC made grades based on how the lenders, developers, and real estate appraisers of the area perceived the neighborhood.  
Through this project, the user can further understand how redlining worked and how it was consistently racially motivated. The maps and descriptions show a continuity of neighborhoods being given a low grade when its population was a majority filled with minority populations. This project allows users to explore the history of redlining and begin to understand the effects that redlining had on communities.  
##### Design  
This site was designed with the use of three mapping programs, Leaflet, MapBox, and OpenStreet Map. A large portion of the project is based on a map that users can explore. The map has many small icons and intricate details, so the project is best to be viewed on a computer. If a user were to attempt to view this project on a mobile phone/device, it would make the experience much more difficult. The map requires the user to zoom into different cities, and when done so the map and descriptions are placed next to each other. Because of this layout, viewing this portion of the project on a mobile device is nearly impossible.  
The project has four main sections, the Map, Introduction, Downloads and Data, and About. The site’s ability to zoom into any specific area or neighborhood on the map that the user wishes to explore and examine the descriptions is a small detail added to the project but makes the user’s experience much more enjoyable.  
##### Credit  
There were hundreds of individuals that contributed to this project. The project was developed by three teams at four universities (The University of Richmond, Virginia Tech, The University of Maryland, and Duke University). Additionally, the project pulled in highly valued researchers, authors, and acclaimed professors from across the country. The project’s funding came from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, The Virginia Tech College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, and MapBox provided base tiles.

##### Findings  
Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America does an excellent job of combing the history of redlining and technology in an easily digestible and navigatable way.   

![Maps](https://lsix642.github.io/Lizzie-S./images/IM3maps.png)  

The map allows the user to explore replicas of the maps the HOLC created by clicking on one of the colored dots that represent different cities across the country. From there the user can zoom into specific neighborhoods and click on a neighborhood that they would like to view. When the user clicks on a specific neighborhood, a description of the grade shows up. Under these descriptions, the user can choose to click on a scan of the original documentation of the area or a shortened or full description. By allowing the user to choose the information they would like to receive and how they would like to receive it, the project directors allowed for a more interactive experience for their users. Additionally, the neighborhood maps are able to be viewed in three separate ways, a full map, a graded map, or a polygon map. The full map feature is hard to read as the maps lay over each other and parts of the maps are missing because of the overlapping. With that said, users are able to easily combat this issue by using the polygon or graded map option.

The map has shaded areas, green, blue, yellow, and red. These are helpful in deciphering what the grade of the neighborhood is, but the key only uses one or two words to describe each color. With that said, it would be hard to describe these colors as they are based on grades that vary widely. When you click on one of the dots it will zoom you into a small map of a city. From there the user can explore each section of the neighborhood separately and see the description of the segment selected.

The project also consists of an introduction section that brings the user through the history of the HOLC and the repercussions of their actions. The section is quite lengthy with little to no pictures and some of the paragraphs are very long. This layout could result in the reader losing attention and just skimming the important materials. On the other hand, the information is critical to understanding the maps and why the HOLC project held such importance in prolonging segregation. If this section had more pictures and the paragraphs were shorter, the user would be less likely to lose interest.

Additionally, there is a downloads and data section next to the introduction. Under this tab, the user has the opportunity to explore the project through different programs. Moreover, the user can use the search bar to search by state and city for the maps available and, if applicable, the area description images. This is an excellent feature as it allows the user to see the city they want without having to guess and pick on each dot until you find the city you are looking for.  
Finally, there is an about section that brings the user through a comprehensive overview of everyone involved in making the project and their roles. Although this section does not discuss the technology used, the user is able to fully understand every step that went into the project.  
##### Conclusion  
Overall, this project is very well put together, with just a few issues here and there. The project not only informs the user of the HOLC project from 1935-1940, but it also allows the user to explore and learn more about this history through an interactive and comprehensive map.
