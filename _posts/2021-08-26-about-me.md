About Me

Hello! I am Lizzie Six and I am a senior at ![Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/), in Newport News, Virginia. I am a third-year but I was lucky enough to have access to college-level classes in high school to skip my freshman year. I am studying social work and leadership in hopes of going into policy reform following receiving my masterâ€™s degree. I use she/her pronouns.
I am extremely involved on and off-campus. I am the kind of person who likes to stay busy. When I am idle I can become very anxious. Below I have compiled a list of all my involvements for this upcoming school year.
