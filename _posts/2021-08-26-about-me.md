Hello! I am Lizzie Six and I am a senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/), in Newport News, Virginia. I am a third-year but I was lucky enough to have access to college-level classes in high school to skip my freshman year. I am studying social work and leadership in hopes of going into policy reform following receiving my master’s degree. I use she/her pronouns.  

I am extremely involved on and off-campus. I am the kind of person who likes to stay busy. When I am idle I can become very anxious. Below I have compiled a list of all my involvements for this upcoming school year.

As stated previously, following receiving my master’s in either child welfare or social policy, I would like to work in policy reform. More specifically, I would like to work towards changes in **child welfare programs** and **housing discrepancies**. I am hoping to start my advocacy journey in NYC because the city itself is so diverse and offers a wide range of populations that deserve help. Following my time in NYC, I would like to move to Washington D.C. and explore lobbying within Congress. Prior to this year, I had never thought about running for Congressional office, but the concept has increasingly become intriguing. 

The digital humanities have always intrigued me, but I had never thought I would be able to understand all of the intricate details that go into digital humanities projects. As I want to go into policy reform, _having an in-depth understanding of the digital humanities is crucial to reaching constituents and policymakers_. 

To close out this post, I wanted to share some of my favorite things in life. I have an obsession with Grey’s Anatomy. I have watched all 17 seasons at least 3 times. I have a 15-year-old puppy named Sadie Silly Six. She is the favorite in the house. She loves to dress up and even has her own car seat. Yes, my mom makes me sit in the backseat.
